To dupe:
 
You need 2 people, a donkey and a chest on it
 
One person must open the inventory of the donkey (don't sit on it, just crouch and open inventory of the donkey)
 
The second person must come close and must be in the same chunk and has to leave the server and rejoin. After that the person should have all of the items that were in the donkey in his/her inventory, so that means they were duplicated, one in donkey and one in the 2nd player's inventory.
